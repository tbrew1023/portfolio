        <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
        <p>Sonic Velocity is an infinite runner platformer where you run, jump, and slide over obstacles to get to the goal ring, and stop Dr. Eggman from stealing all of the chaos emeralds!</p>
        <h2>Creative Process:</h2>
        <p>Sonic Velocity was a project I worked on during my 8th grade summer break. Not only am I a huge Sonic the Hedgehog fan, but I would always make little fan games when I was younger and it was always a lot of fun designing levels and puzzles. I used Game Maker 8.0 to build this game, and It was my first complete game that I'd made without the assistance of a pre-existing engine.</p>
        <h2>Results:</h2>
        <p>Sadly, the source files for the game were on a PC that suddenly died, taking not only Sonic Velocity but the near hundred other fan games that I had made. Luckily I still have the exe files for Sonic Velocity and Sonic GX, which can be downloaded from the link below. Making this game really gave me a nice handle on how to be creative with software and gave me a nice foundation for going further with software development and design.</p>
